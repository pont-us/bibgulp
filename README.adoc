# bibgulp

https://github.com/pont-us/bibgulp

## Use case

You are downloading BibTeX (or RIS) records from journal websites for use in
a bibliography, and you want to avoid the effort of opening each .bib file,
manually fixing whatever mangled attempt at BibTeX the website has provided
you with, and copy-pasting it into your master BibTeX file.

## What bibgulp does

Bibgulp is a small Python script which does the following:

1. It runs in the background watching your downloads directory.
2. When a BibTeX file appears in the directory, bibgulp reads the file and
   corrects and standardizes various bugs and misformattings that it knows
   about. If a RIS file appears, it will convert it to BibTeX and then apply
   the same corrections.
3. It then places a neatly and consistently formatted version of the corrected
   BibTeX file on your clipboard, ready to paste into your master BibTeX
   file.

## Usage

`./bibgulp.py /path/to/my/downloads/directory`

## Requirements

 - Python >=3.5
 - the Python `bibtexparser` package
 - the `ris2xml` and `xml2bib` utilities from the `bibutils` package,
   for converting RIS to BibTeX
 - the `xsel` command-line utility (to put things on the clipboard)

## Notes

This is a very slapdash, quick-and-dirty utility written for my own use, with
various ad-hoc heuristics added over time as I come across new creative misuses
of BibTeX by journal publishers. Often the output still needs a little
hand-editing, but far less than raw BibTeX downloads usually do.
